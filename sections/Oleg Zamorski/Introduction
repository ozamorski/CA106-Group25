My name is Oleg Zamorski and the Esports game I will be covering is Street Fighter 5. Street Fighter 5 is the 5th game of the Street Fighter franchise. It is a fighting game where 2 players go head to head and fight until one of them gets knocked out and wins the round and there could be many rules. It has a long history of all the Street Fighter games but I will talk about where it originated the most popular game of them all and then Street Fighter 5 and where it is now in the present time. It was in various tournaments and there are a lot of professional Esports players that compete in those Street Fighter tournaments for a cash prize. I will be talking about the history and development of the game and talk about the different professional players that competed against each other in various tournaments and I will talk about the tournaments as a whole and then summarise everything at the end.
