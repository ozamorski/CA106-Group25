                <p>
                    Dota 2’s competitive scene is always evolving, with teams making roster changes, some Orgs quitting the game altogether, and new ones forming from the ashes.

                <p>
                    In The International’s 10 year history, only one team has ever managed to win the tournament twice, OG. The team formerly known as Monkey Business re-branded to OG in 2015. They went through many roster changes and player shuffles, but the one constant was N0tail, a veteran in the scene who was a founding member of Team Secret as well as Fnatic. N0tail was always the funny guy in interviews, a charismatic young man passionate for the game. His passion was rewarded when he won TI8 in 2018 with OG, and came back for the double in 2019.

                <p>
                    Natus Vincere (shortened to Na’Vi) have been in the world of Dota since DotA Allstars, and they were the strongest non-Chinese team in the world back then. They were among the 16 teams invited to the first International, and they won it in a convincing fashion. One year later, at TI2, they came second, but not without pulling off what has become collectively known simply as “The Play”, the best play ever made in the game’s history. The next year, they came second again. The year after, after disappointing results, the team underwent major roster changes.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Alliance was formed in 2013 with an all-Swedish roster. They dominated in TI3, beating Na’Vi 3-2 in the grand finals. During that tournament, they had played 26 games, losing only 3 of them, 2 of them to Na'Vi in the grand finals. They had a very impressive 88% win rate in that tournament, and it established the squad as a tier 1 team. The roster has undergone many changes over the years, but Alliance remains a fierce competitor.

                <p>
                    Team Secret was formed in 2014 by players who wanted their team to be run by the players, rather than an Organisation that manages it. They have been very successful since their formation, with many top players from different teams being part of the active roster over the years. There are many, many more Dota teams currently active and competing, however you can already find lots of information about them as well as their detailed history over on <a href="https://liquipedia.net/dota2/Main_Page">Liquipedia.</a>
