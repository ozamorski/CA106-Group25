                <h2>History</h2>
                <p>Dota 2’s history is very extensive, and there are hundreds of hours’ worth of YouTube videos discussing it in great detail. 
                    I’ll attempt to cover the most important times and periods in the game’s long history here.

                <h2>The Beginning</h2>
                <div class="pic">

                    <p class="description">Dota Allstars</p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    In 2003, the hugely popular game, Warcraft III, received an expansion called “Frozen Throne”. This expansion allowed custom maps to be created by users. One of which was DotA Allstars. It was created by a user named Eul, and was based on the Starcraft map, “Aeon of Strife”. DotA (standing for Defence of the Ancients) became more and more popular as custom heroes were added to the game, and the game was updated to be more balanced. 
                    The mod had many developers throughout the years, starting with Eul, then Guinsoo, and then most recently, IceFrog.
                    <br>
                    With a steadily growing and loyal player-base, and the game’s naturally competitive nature, some tournaments began to appear that offered prizes for the teams. However, as this was not an officially published game, but rather a mod of an existing game, securing sponsors was difficult and prize pools were generally small.

                <h2>The Transition</h2>
                <p>
                    After leaving DotA Allstars, Guinsoo went on to work on a new game that also became hugely popular, League of Legends. Valve saw how popular the game was and decided to acquire the rights to Dota. They hired IceFrog and corresponded with him over email on his plans for the game, letting him dictate the sequels future. At Gamescom 2001, Valve announced Dota 2, along with a tournament held live in the venue. The tournament was not a simple generic showcase of the game, it was revolutionary for all of e-sports.
