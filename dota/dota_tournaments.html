                <h2>Dota 2 Tournaments</h2>
                <p>
                    Dota tournaments can be run by independent third-party organisers with or without Valveâ€™s sponsorship, or they can be organised by Valve directly. 
                    Valve sponsored events also carry a set amount of DPC (Dota Pro Circuit) points, which the winners of these tournaments are granted. These points determine which teams will qualify for the International.

                </div>
                <p>When Dota 2 was revealed at Gamescom 2011, it was promoted by having a tournament held at the venue. 
                    The tournament broke records. It featured a grand prize of $1.6 million. To put that into perspective, in 2011 the mean tournament prize pool was $6,313. Valve had invited the best teams from around the world to participate, and ultimately the Ukrainian team Natus Vincere took home the grand prize of $1,000,000. This set a tradition, every year there would be an International tournament, each with a bigger prize than the last. In 2020, the prize pool for The International 10 totalled up to $40 million, where just over half would go to the winning team.

                </div>
                <p>
                    Valve sponsors other big tournaments throughout the year called majors. These are held around the world and carry the most DPC points. 
                    In 2019 There were 4 majors held in Moscow, Disneyland Paris, Chongqing, and Stockholm. Majors have a grand prize pool of $1 million, which is distributed to all of the teams attending. Even places 13-16 get $10,000 per team.</p>

                <h2>Minors</h2>
                <p>
                    Valve also sponsor smaller tournaments called where there are less DPC points up for grabs and smaller prize pools, but it is still a significant sum of money for smaller teams. 
                    Generally, the top tier teams in the world might avoid minors in order to practice for majors or even TI. This gives the smaller teams a chance to earn some money to support themselves as well as earn some DPC points.
